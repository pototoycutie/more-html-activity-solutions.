        Penguins are fascinating birds that are well-adapted to life in the water. They are known for their distinctive black and white plumage and their upright posture. Unlike most birds, penguins are flightless but are excellent swimmers. They use their wings as flippers to propel themselves through the water. Penguins primarily live in the Southern Hemisphere, with some species found in colder regions such as Antarctica.
